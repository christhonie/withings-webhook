Withings → Cloudflare Worker → Intervals
========================================

This project implements a **Cloudflare Worker** that receives notifications from Withings, extracts relevant measurements, and automatically sends them to the **Intervals.icu** service.The Worker is designed to be modular, scalable, and robust, with OAuth token management, payload validation, automatic retries, daily averaging, and support for manual retry.

📌 Main Features
----------------

*   Receives **POST** notifications from Withings (notify) and handles subscription (subscribe)
*   **Routes by notification category (`appli`)**: body composition (`appli=1`), **sleep summaries (`appli=44`)**, and a **sleep-mat check-in** log (`appli=52`, device online after restart)
*   Complete payload validation: userid, startdate, enddate
*   Obtains valid **access token** from KV or automatic refresh
*   Calls Withings API measure?action=getmeas (body) and **v2/sleep?action=getsummary (sleep)** to retrieve data
*   **Daily averaging**: Automatically groups multiple measurements per day and calculates averages
*   Extracts configured fields (weight, muscle mass, body fat, etc.)
*   Sends data to **Intervals.icu** with automatic retry (2 attempts)
*   Duplicate detection to avoid sending the same data twice
*   Saves to KV for manual retry in case of failure
*   **Comprehensive logging system** with configurable verbosity and operation tracking
*   **Telegram notifications** for successful sends and errors (optional)

⚡ Installation
--------------

1.  **Create the Worker** on Cloudflare Workers
2.  **Create KV Namespace** (see Configuration section below)
3.  **Configure environment variables** (see Configuration section below)
4.  **Deploy the Worker** via Wrangler or Cloudflare UI
5.  **Setup OAuth tokens** for each user (see Initial Setup section below)
6.  **Create the custom wellness fields** in Intervals.icu (see [Creating the Custom Wellness Fields](#-creating-the-custom-wellness-fields-in-intervalsicu) below) — required before body-composition metrics will be accepted

🔧 Configuration
----------------

### 1\. Cloudflare KV Namespace (Required First)

The Worker needs a KV namespace to store tokens and data:

**How to configure it:**

*   In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Workers → KV
*   Click "Create Namespace"
*   Assign a name (e.g. withings-kv) and click "Create"
*   Go back to your Worker, go to Settings → Variables
*   Add an environment variable:
    *   Variable name: MY\_KV
    *   Value: select the newly created namespace from the dropdown   
*   Click "Save"

### 2\. Withings OAuth Credentials

*   WITHINGS\_CLIENT\_ID - Withings OAuth client ID
*   WITHINGS\_CLIENT\_SECRET - Withings OAuth client secret

**How to obtain them:**

*   Go to [Withings Developer](https://developer.withings.com/)
*   Register/Login to your account
*   Create a new application
*   In the app dashboard, copy:
    *   Client ID → WITHINGS\_CLIENT\_ID
    *   Client Secret → WITHINGS\_CLIENT\_SECRET (keep this value secret)
        

### 3\. Intervals.icu API Credentials

*   INTERVALS\_ATHLETE\_ID - Intervals athlete ID
*   INTERVALS\_API\_KEY - Intervals API Key

**How to obtain them:**

*   Login to your Intervals.icu account
*   Go to Settings → API
*   Copy your Athlete ID → INTERVALS\_ATHLETE\_ID
*   Generate a new API Key → INTERVALS\_API\_KEY

### 4\. Telegram Bot Notifications (Optional)

*   TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN - Telegram bot token for notifications
*   TELEGRAM\_CHAT\_ID - Telegram chat ID to receive notifications

**How to obtain them:**

*   Create a new bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
*   Send /newbot and follow the instructions
*   Copy the bot token → TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN
*   Start a chat with your bot and send any message
*   Visit https://api.telegram.org/bot/getUpdates
*   Find your chat ID in the response → TELEGRAM\_CHAT\_ID

🚀 Initial Setup (One-time per user)
------------------------------------

Before the Worker can function, you need to obtain the initial OAuth tokens for each user. This is a **one-time setup** per user.

### Step 1: Get Authorization Code

1.  **Visit the OAuth URL:**
```js
https://account.withings.com/oauth2\_user/authorize2?response\_type=code&client\_id=YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID&redirect\_uri=YOUR\_REDIRECT\_URI&scope=user.metrics,user.activity,user.sleepevents&state=random\_string
```
  *   Replace YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID with your actual client ID
  *   Replace YOUR\_REDIRECT\_URI with your configured redirect URI
  *   The user will be redirected to your redirect URI with a code parameter
  *   **Scopes:** `user.metrics` (weight/body), `user.activity` (sleep summaries), `user.sleepevents` (sleep-mat device events). If you previously authorized with only `user.metrics`, you **must** re-run this flow to add sleep — appending scope does not upgrade an existing token. See the [Sleep Tracking](#sleep-tracking) section.

2.  **Extract the code from the redirect URL:**
   *   The code will be in the URL parameter: ?code=ABC123...
   *   **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The authorization code expires in **10 minutes**, so you must use it quickly!
        

### Step 2: Exchange Code for Tokens

**Execute this command immediately after getting the code:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://wbsapi.withings.net/v2/oauth2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "action=requesttoken" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

**Response will contain:**

*   access\_token (expires in 3 hours)
*   refresh\_token (expires in 6 months)
*   expires\_in (seconds until access\_token expires)

### Step 3: Store Tokens in KV

Save the response tokens to your Cloudflare KV namespace:

**Key: token\_data\_${userid}**

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token", 
  "expires_at": 1234567890,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Key: refresh\_${userid}**

```
your_refresh_token_string
```

> **Note:** After this initial setup, the Worker handles automatic token refresh. You only need to do this once per user.

### Step 4: Register Webhook with Withings

Configure your webhook URL in the Withings Developer dashboard to point to your Worker URL.

📊 Daily Averaging Feature
--------------------------

The Worker automatically handles multiple measurements per day by calculating daily averages:

### How it works:

1.  **Groups measurements by date** (YYYY-MM-DD)
2.  **Calculates averages** for each field when multiple measurements exist
3.  **Preserves single measurements** as-is when only one exists
4.  **Uses noon timestamp** (12:00:00) for daily averages
5.  **Tracks which fields were averaged** for transparency

### Benefits:

*   **Prevents duplicate data** when multiple measurements occur on the same day
*   **Provides meaningful daily values** instead of random measurement selection
*   **Maintains data consistency** with Intervals.icu's daily wellness format
*   **Reduces API calls** by combining multiple measurements into one send

### Example:

If you weigh yourself 3 times on January 15th:

*   Morning: 75.2 kg
*   Afternoon: 75.5 kg
*   Evening: 75.1 kg

The Worker sends: weight: 75.3 (average) with timestamp 2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z

🔧 Logging Configuration
------------------------

The Worker includes a comprehensive logging system that can be customized:

### Log Levels
```js
const LOG_CONFIG = {
  level: "INFO",       // ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
  
  categories: {
    data: true,        // Measurements, fields, duplicates
    api: true,         // Withings, Intervals, tokens  
    process: false,    // Group processing details
    general: true      // Validation, errors
  },
  
  operations: {
    measurements: true,    // Measurement processing
    fields: false,         // Field extraction details
    duplicates: true,      // Duplicate checking
    intervals: true,       // Intervals API calls
    tokens: false,         // Token operations
    retries: true,         // Retry operations
    averaging: true        // Daily averaging operations
  }
};
```

### Customizing Logs

*   Set level: "DEBUG" for maximum verbosity during development
*   Enable specific categories and operations based on your debugging needs
*   Production recommendation: level: "INFO" with essential operations enabled

🔧 Field Mapping
----------------

The Worker supports the following Withings measurements:

## 🔧 Field Mapping

The Worker supports the following Withings measurements:

| Withings Field | Withings Type | Intervals Field | Decimals |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Weight | 1 | weight | 3 |
| Body Fat % | 6 | bodyFat | 2 |
| Muscle Mass | 76 | WithingsMuscleMass | 2 |
| Water Mass | 77 | WithingsWaterMass | 2 |
| Bone Mass | 88 | WithingsBoneMass | 3 |
| Lean Mass | 5 | WithingsLeanMass | 2 |
| Visceral Fat | 170 | WithingsVisceralFat | 1 |
| BMR | 226 | WithingsBMR | 0 |
| Metabolic Age | 227 | WithingsMetabolicAge | 0 |

> To add new fields, update the `FIELD_MAPPING` object in the code.

🔧 Creating the Custom Wellness Fields in Intervals.icu
------------------------------------------------------

Intervals.icu has only two **built-in** wellness fields used by this Worker — `weight` and `bodyFat` — which work with no setup. **Every other field in the mapping table above is a _custom wellness field_ that you must create in Intervals.icu _before_ the Worker can send it.** Until the field exists, the Intervals API rejects the request with:

```
422 Unrecognized wellness field [WithingsMuscleMass] for athlete iXXXXXX
```

and it rejects the **entire day's record** — so `weight` and `bodyFat` for that day are dropped too, not just the unknown field.

### Where to create them (the step people get wrong)

Custom **wellness** fields are a *different feature* from custom **activity / sport** fields:

- ✅ **Correct** — open a day's **wellness entry dialog** (home / calendar → click the day's wellness entry), then click **“Fields”** → the **“+”** button to add a new field.
- ❌ **Wrong** — *Settings → Sport Settings → (Ride / Other) → Custom Fields*. Those are **activity** fields; the wellness API never reads them, so using them reproduces the same 422.

### Field configuration

Create one custom wellness field per row below. **The `Code` is the only value that must be exact** — it is case-sensitive and must match the **Intervals Field** value from the mapping table above (the `intervalsField` the Worker sends). The **`Name`** can be any friendly label you like.

| Name | Code (must match exactly) | Type | Unit | Min | Max | Prefix | Format | Suffix | Example | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|------|------|-----|-----|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Muscle Mass | `WithingsMuscleMass` | Numeric | kg | 0 | 100 | — | `.2f` | `kg` | `61.82` | Muscle weight (BIA) |
| Water Mass | `WithingsWaterMass` | Numeric | kg | 0 | 100 | — | `.2f` | `kg` | `43.06` | Total body water |
| Bone Mass | `WithingsBoneMass` | Numeric | kg | 0 | 10 | — | `.3f` | `kg` | `3.220` | Dry skeletal mass |
| Lean Mass | `WithingsLeanMass` | Numeric | kg | 0 | 150 | — | `.2f` | `kg` | `65.06` | Fat-free mass |
| Visceral Fat | `WithingsVisceralFat` | Numeric | — | 0 | 30 | — | `.1f` | — | `8.0` | Abdominal fat index |
| BMR | `WithingsBMR` | Numeric | kcal | 0 | 6000 | — | `.0f` | `kcal` | `1750` | Resting calorie burn |
| Metabolic Age | `WithingsMetabolicAge` | Numeric | years | 0 | 120 | — | `.0f` | `yr` | `35` | BMR vs. age group |

Notes on the columns:

- **Format** uses [d3-format](https://d3js.org/d3-format) notation: `.2f` = 2 decimals, `.3f` = 3 decimals, `.1f` = 1 decimal, `.0f` = integer. Keep it consistent with the **Decimals** column in the mapping table above.
- **Suffix** includes a **leading space** (`" kg"`) so values render as `83.35 kg`, not `83.35kg`. A `—` means leave that field blank.
- ⚠️ **The OK button stays greyed out until the `Example` value matches the `Format`.** For example, with format `.2f` the Example must have exactly two decimals (`61.82`). The validation message only appears **after you click into (touch) the Example field** — so if **OK** is disabled and nothing looks wrong, focus the Example field and correct its decimals to match the format.
- **Only create the fields your scale actually reports.** Most Body / Body+ scales send the first four (muscle, water, bone, lean mass). Visceral Fat, BMR and Metabolic Age (Withings types 170 / 226 / 227) come from higher-end models only — create them only if your scale sends them; otherwise they simply stay empty.

For what each metric means, see Withings’ [body composition & BIA guide](https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/22480153133841-Body-Smart-Learn-more-about-body-composition-and-bioelectrical-impedance-analysis-BIA).

😴 Sleep Tracking (Sleep Analyzer / Sleep Mat)
----------------------------------------------

The Worker also ingests **sleep** from Withings under-mattress devices (*Withings Sleep* /
*Sleep Mat*, *Sleep Analyzer*, *Sleep Rx*). Sleep uses a **different notification category and
API endpoint** than body composition:

* Withings sends a notification with **`appli=44`** ("sleep summary") when a night's data is ready.
* The Worker then calls **`https://wbsapi.withings.net/v2/sleep?action=getsummary`** (not `measure/getmeas`).
* Each night maps to one Intervals **wellness** record (built-in `sleepSecs`/`sleepScore`/… plus custom `Withings*` fields).

### ⚠️ Required: re-authorize with the sleep scopes

Sleep needs OAuth scopes the original body-only setup does not have:

| Scope | Enables |
|-------|---------|
| `user.metrics` | Weight / body composition (`appli=1`) |
| `user.activity` | **Sleep summaries** (`appli=44`, `v2/sleep`) |
| `user.sleepevents` | Sleep-mat device events: **inflate-done check-in** (`appli=52`), bed in/out (`50`/`51`) |

**Appending a scope does not upgrade an existing token.** If you set the integration up for
body composition only, you must **re-run the OAuth flow** (Initial Setup → Steps 1–3) to mint a
token carrying `user.activity`+`user.sleepevents`, then re-subscribe. The helper does both:

```bash
./scripts/withings-bootstrap.sh authorize        # URL now requests all three scopes
./scripts/withings-bootstrap.sh token <code>     # re-seeds KV and subscribes appli 1, 44, 52
./scripts/withings-bootstrap.sh list <userid>    # verify appli 1, 44, 52 subscriptions
```

If the token is missing `user.activity`, the Worker logs an explicit warning
(`Sleep getsummary failed … likely missing 'user.activity' scope`) instead of failing silently.

### Device check-in (`appli=52`) — and the scale has none

When the Sleep Mat powers on or restarts it re-inflates/calibrates its sensor, which fires an
**`appli=52` ("inflate done")** notification — a de-facto "device online" signal. The Worker
logs this (and, if Telegram is enabled, pings you) but pushes nothing to Intervals. **The scale
has no equivalent** — it only notifies (`appli=1`) when a new measurement is taken, never on
connect.

### Sessions, naps and dates

* Brief awakenings / bathroom trips stay within **one** night session (counted as
  `WithingsWakeupCount` / `WithingsWakeAfterSleep` / `WithingsOutOfBedCount`). Withings only
  starts a separate session after a *sustained* absence.
* If a night is split into multiple series, the Worker **aggregates per night date** with a
  **per-field rule** (`combine` in `SLEEP_FIELD_MAPPING`): durations & counts are **summed**;
  HR/respiration bounds take **min**/**max**; rates & intensities (avg HR, respiration, HRV,
  breathing disturbance) are **duration-weighted averages**; **efficiency** is recomputed from the
  combined `Σtotal_sleep_time / Σtotal_timeinbed`; sleep-onset and final-wake **latencies** come
  from the **first**/**last** series; and the **sleep score** from the **main (longest)** series.
  For a single series every rule is a pass-through. (Daytime naps on the same date are currently
  folded into the night total — see the naps note.)
* The night/date comes from Withings’ own `series[].date` (in your account timezone), so sessions
  that start after midnight are dated correctly. Stored under wellness date `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Device field availability (which device reports what)

Create only the fields **your** device reports — others are simply dropped (harmless). Run a real
sleep sync (or `getsummary`) once to confirm your device's set.

| Field group | Withings Sleep / Sleep Mat | Sleep Analyzer (EU/AU) | Sleep Rx (US) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Stages, score, efficiency, latency, WASO, wakeups, time-in-bed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HR (avg/min/max), respiration (avg/min/max), HRV (rmssd) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Snoring + episodes, breathing-disturbance intensity | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (`apnea_hypopnea_index`)** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

### Sleep field mapping

Durations are stored in **minutes** for custom fields (the built-in `sleepSecs` stays seconds).
`★` = custom wellness field you must create.

| Withings field | Intervals field | Built-in / Custom | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| total_sleep_time | `sleepSecs` | built-in | seconds |
| sleep_score | `sleepScore` | built-in | 0–100 |
| hr_average | `avgSleepingHR` | built-in | bpm |
| rr_average | `respiration` | built-in | br/min |
| rmssd | `hrv` | built-in | ms |
| deepsleepduration | `WithingsSleepDeep` ★ | custom | min |
| lightsleepduration | `WithingsSleepLight` ★ | custom | min |
| remsleepduration | `WithingsSleepREM` ★ | custom | min |
| total_timeinbed | `WithingsTimeInBed` ★ | custom | min |
| sleep_latency | `WithingsSleepLatency` ★ | custom | min |
| wakeup_latency | `WithingsWakeupLatency` ★ | custom | min |
| wakeupduration (WASO) | `WithingsWakeAfterSleep` ★ | custom | min |
| wakeupcount | `WithingsWakeupCount` ★ | custom | count |
| out_of_bed_count | `WithingsOutOfBedCount` ★ | custom | count |
| nb_rem_episodes | `WithingsRemEpisodes` ★ | custom | count |
| sleep_efficiency | `WithingsSleepEfficiency` ★ | custom | % |
| snoring | `WithingsSnoring` ★ | custom | min |
| snoringepisodecount | `WithingsSnoringEpisodes` ★ | custom | count |
| breathing_disturbances_intensity | `WithingsBreathingDisturbance` ★ | custom | score |
| hr_min | `WithingsSleepHRMin` ★ | custom | bpm |
| hr_max | `WithingsSleepHRMax` ★ | custom | bpm |
| rr_min | `WithingsRespirationMin` ★ | custom | br/min |
| rr_max | `WithingsRespirationMax` ★ | custom | br/min |
| apnea_hypopnea_index | `WithingsApneaIndex` ★ | custom (Analyzer only) | /hr |

### Sleep custom wellness fields to create

Create these the same way as the body-composition custom fields (wellness entry dialog →
**Fields** → **+**; Code must match **exactly**; the **Example** must match the **Format** or
the OK button stays greyed out). Suffix shown with a leading space.

| Name | Code | Type | Unit | Min | Max | Format | Suffix | Example | Device |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sleep Deep | `WithingsSleepDeep` | Numeric | min | 0 | 1440 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `95` | All |
| Sleep Light | `WithingsSleepLight` | Numeric | min | 0 | 1440 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `220` | All |
| Sleep REM | `WithingsSleepREM` | Numeric | min | 0 | 1440 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `90` | All |
| Time In Bed | `WithingsTimeInBed` | Numeric | min | 0 | 1440 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `460` | All |
| Sleep Latency | `WithingsSleepLatency` | Numeric | min | 0 | 600 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `12` | All |
| Wakeup Latency | `WithingsWakeupLatency` | Numeric | min | 0 | 600 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `8` | All |
| Wake After Sleep | `WithingsWakeAfterSleep` | Numeric | min | 0 | 600 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `25` | All |
| Wakeup Count | `WithingsWakeupCount` | Numeric | — | 0 | 100 | `.0f` | — | `3` | All |
| Out Of Bed Count | `WithingsOutOfBedCount` | Numeric | — | 0 | 100 | `.0f` | — | `1` | All |
| REM Episodes | `WithingsRemEpisodes` | Numeric | — | 0 | 100 | `.0f` | — | `4` | All |
| Sleep Efficiency | `WithingsSleepEfficiency` | Numeric | % | 0 | 100 | `.1f` | `"%"` | `91.2` | All |
| Snoring | `WithingsSnoring` | Numeric | min | 0 | 600 | `.0f` | `" min"` | `8` | All |
| Snoring Episodes | `WithingsSnoringEpisodes` | Numeric | — | 0 | 100 | `.0f` | — | `2` | All |
| Breathing Disturbance | `WithingsBreathingDisturbance` | Numeric | — | 0 | 100 | `.0f` | — | `30` | All |

| Apnea Index | `WithingsApneaIndex` | Numeric | /hr | 0 | 100 | `.1f` | `"/hr"` | `4.5` | Analyzer only |

> Duration unit is controlled by `SLEEP_DURATION_UNIT` in `worker.js` (`"minutes"` default;
> `"hours"` or `"seconds"` also supported). If you change it, update the field Unit/Format above.

🔧 Payload Validation
---------------------

Every notify payload is validated:

*   **userid**: required, numeric string
*   **startdate**: optional, default "0", numeric string (Unix timestamp in seconds)
*   **enddate**: optional, default current timestamp, numeric string (Unix timestamp in seconds)
*   **enddate** must be greater than or equal to **startdate**

> **Important**: Withings expects Unix timestamps in **seconds**, not milliseconds. If using JavaScript timestamps, divide by 1000.

If the payload is invalid, the Worker responds with **400** and logs the error.

🔑 Rotating / Updating Credentials
----------------------------------

Credentials (`INTERVALS_API_KEY`, `WITHINGS_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) are stored as encrypted
Worker secrets. Updating one takes effect on the **next request — no redeploy needed**.

**Update a secret** (any one of):

* **Wrangler, from `.dev.vars`:** edit the value in `.dev.vars`, then `wrangler secret bulk .dev.vars`.
* **Wrangler, single secret:** `wrangler secret put INTERVALS_API_KEY` (prompts; input hidden).
* **Cloudflare dashboard:** Workers & Pages → `withings-webhook` → Settings → Variables and Secrets → edit the secret → Save.

**Then backfill anything that failed while the credential was stale.** A rotated Intervals key
causes the wellness `PUT` to return **401**, which the Worker logs at `WARN`/`ERROR` and parks in
a `retry_*` KV key (it does **not** appear at `INFO` — filter the log view to WARN/ERROR). To recover:

1.  Re-trigger the affected path(s) by POSTing a notify to the Worker for the date range, e.g.:

    ```bash
    # body composition (appli=1)
    curl -X POST "$WORKER_URL" -d "userid=$UID" -d "appli=1" \
      -d "startdate=$(date -d '7 days ago' +%s)" -d "enddate=$(date +%s)"
    # sleep (appli=44)
    curl -X POST "$WORKER_URL" -d "userid=$UID" -d "appli=44" \
      -d "startdate=$(date -d '2 days ago' +%s)" -d "enddate=$(date +%s)"
    ```
2.  Confirm the data landed in Intervals, then delete the now-stale `retry_${userid}_*` KV keys.

> **Tip:** verify a key before relying on it — `curl -u "API_KEY:<key>" https://intervals.icu/api/v1/athlete/<id>/profile` should return **200**.

🔄 Token Management
-------------------

*   Tokens stored in KV for each userid
*   **Token Expiration Times:**
    *   access\_token: **3 hours** (automatically refreshed by Worker)
    *   refresh\_token: **6 months** (used to get new access\_token)
    *   authorization\_code: **10 minutes** (only during initial setup)
        
*   If access\_token is expired or missing, **automatic refresh** is performed via refresh\_token
*   Automatic retry up to **3 attempts** on error 601 (Rate Limited)
*   Worker checks token validity with 60-second buffer before expiration

✅ Sending Data to Intervals
---------------------------

*   **Daily averaging** applied when multiple measurements exist for the same date
*   Only **new** or **modified** fields are sent (duplicate detection)
*   Automatic retry **2 times** if sending fails
*   If all retries fail, data is saved to KV for future manual retry
*   Uses latest measurement's grpid for duplicate checking when averaging

📦 KV Storage

| `retry_${userid}_${grpid}` | Body data to send manually if retry failed |
| `sent_${userid}_sleep_${date}` | Sleep fields already sent for a night (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `retry_${userid}_sleep_${date}` | Sleep data to send manually if retry failed |
| `checkin_${userid}` | Last sleep-mat check-in (`appli=52` inflate-done): `lastCheckinAt` |

📱 Telegram Notifications
-------------------------

The Worker can send notifications to Telegram for successful data sends and errors. This is **optional** and requires additional configuration.

### Notification Types

#### **Successful Data Send**
```
✅ Withings Data Sent
👤 User: 12345
⏰ Time: 2024-01-15 12:30:00
📊 Days: 2

1. 2024-01-15
   Fields: weight, bodyFat
   Values: weight: 75.5 (avg), bodyFat: 1.52
   📊 3 measurements averaged
   Status: 200

2. 2024-01-14
   Fields: muscleMass
   Values: muscleMass: 45.2
   Status: 200
```
#### **Error Notification**
```
🚨 Withings Worker Error
👤 User: 12345
⏰ Time: 2024-01-15 12:30:00
❌ Error: Token refresh failed
```

#### **No Data Notification**
```
📊 Withings Worker
👤 User: 12345
⏰ Time: 2024-01-15 12:30:00
ℹ️ No data to send
```

### Configuration

Set these environment variables to enable notifications:

*   TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN - Your bot token from @BotFather
*   TELEGRAM\_CHAT\_ID - Your chat ID

If these variables are not set, notifications will be disabled automatically.

### Customization

You can modify the notification behavior in the TELEGRAM\_CONFIG object:

*   enabled: true - Enable/disable notifications
*   includeData: true - Include field values in notifications
*   includeErrors: true - Send notifications for errors

⚠️ Error Handling
-----------------

*   All errors are logged to console with detailed context
*   Main flows are not blocked by errors: the Worker responds immediately to Withings
*   Automatic retries managed for tokens and Intervals sending
*   Persistent data saved for manual retry if necessary
*   Comprehensive error logging helps with troubleshooting
*   **Rate limiting** handled automatically with exponential backoff

🌐 General Flow
---------------

### Initial Setup Flow

1.  **OAuth Authorization** → User authorizes your app via Withings OAuth
2.  **Token Exchange** → Exchange authorization code for access/refresh tokens
3.  **Token Storage** → Store tokens in Cloudflare KV for each user
4.  **Webhook Registration** → Withings calls your Worker URL for notifications

### Runtime Flow (After Setup)

1.  HTTP request → HEAD or POST
2.  subscribe → immediate response {status:0}
3.  notify → payload validation
4.  Immediate response "OK" + **route by `appli`**:
    *   `appli=1` (or absent) → `ctx.waitUntil(handleNotify)` — body composition
    *   `appli=44` → `ctx.waitUntil(handleSleepNotify)` — sleep summary
    *   `appli=52` → log sleep-mat check-in (no Intervals push); `50`/`51` → ignored
5.  Retrieve valid access token (KV cache or refresh)
6.  **Body:** call `measure?action=getmeas` → group by date + daily averages.
    **Sleep:** call `v2/sleep?action=getsummary` → aggregate series per night date
7.  Extract & map configured fields (body via `FIELD_MAPPING`, sleep via `SLEEP_FIELD_MAPPING`)
8.  Check already sent (dedupe per group / per night) → send new fields to Intervals
9.  Drop-unknown-and-retry on 422; automatic retry on failed send → save to KV for manual retry
10.  Send Telegram notification (if configured)
11.  Complete logging at every step

🛠️ Tips
--------

### Development

*   Update FIELD\_MAPPING to add new Withings measurement types
*   Set LOG\_CONFIG.level: "DEBUG" for detailed debugging
*   Enable specific log categories based on what you're troubleshooting
*   Use daily averaging feature to handle multiple daily measurements gracefully

### Production

*   Set LOG\_CONFIG.level: "INFO" for optimal performance
*   Monitor Worker logs for ERROR level messages
*   Set up alerts for critical errors using log monitoring
*   Enable Telegram notifications for real-time status updates

### Monitoring

*   Track retry patterns to identify potential API issues
*   Monitor token refresh frequency to detect authentication problems
*   Use averaging logs to understand measurement patterns
*   Periodic KV cleanup recommended to avoid old data accumulation

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"Invalid userid"**  
  Ensure `userid` is a numeric string.

- **"Token refresh failed"**  
  Check if the refresh token has expired (valid for 6 months).

- **"All retries failed"**  
  Check Intervals.icu API status and credentials.

- **No data sent**  
  Verify field mapping matches your Withings device capabilities.

- **Timestamp issues**  
  Remember Withings uses Unix timestamps in **seconds**, not milliseconds.

- **"Not implemented" (status 2554)**  
  This error happens if you call the wrong endpoint.  
  Always use:
  https://wbsapi.withings.net/notify
  (⚠️ do not use `/v2/notify`)

- **Old callback URL still shown in `action=list` after GUI callback URL edit**  
  The Withings Developer portal shows the **global callback URL** for your app,  
  but API subscriptions (`action=list`) display the URL that was saved at the moment of `subscribe`.  
  Updating the portal does not automatically update old subscriptions.  

  **Solution:** Revoke the old subscription and create a new one with the updated URL.  
  (Access/refresh tokens are unaffected.)

  Example workflow:
  ```bash
  # 1. List current subscription(s)
  curl -X POST "https://wbsapi.withings.net/notify" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -d "action=list&appli=1"

  # 2. Revoke old subscription (use appli + old callbackurl from step 1)
  curl -X POST "https://wbsapi.withings.net/notify" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -d "action=revoke&appli=1&callbackurl=https://old-url/withings"

  # 3. Subscribe again with the new callback URL
  curl -X POST "https://wbsapi.withings.net/notify" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -d "action=subscribe&appli=1&callbackurl=https://new-url/withings&comment=myapp"

  # 4. Verify subscription now points to the correct callback
  curl -X POST "https://wbsapi.withings.net/notify" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -d "action=list&appli=1"
